### Notes

* I've completed this project quite in hurry, in 3 days of work; code is not commented and can be a bit messy in some components, even though I tried to keep it as clean as possible; I haven't used a type system; site might be not totally responsive;
* While learning Redux, I took the chance to try out [Ramda.js](http://ramdajs.com/) and [react-semantic-ui](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction) too;
* Project is still in debug mode.
